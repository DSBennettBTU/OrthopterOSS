We recently developed a CNN based classifier using the opensoundscape system (Lapp et al. 2023), which runs in Python to automatically classifiy the songs of orthoptera (grasshoppers and bush crickets) which have been detected
on audio recorders, such as those used in passive acoustic monitoring of bats and birds. 

The original version refers to the one described in our recent publication 
("Recent technological developments allow for passive acoustic monitoring of Orthoptera (grasshoppers and crickets) in research and conservation across a broad range of temporal and spatial scales") 
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.baae.2025.03.004

This version currently classifies 17 species: 
Chorthippus albomarginatus
Chorthippus apricarius
Chorthippus biguttulus
Chorthippus brunneus
Chorthippus dorsatus
Chorthippus mollis
Conocephalus dorsalis
Decticus verrucivorus
Leptophyes punctatissima
Metrioptera brachyptera
Pholidoptera griseoaptera
Pseudochorthippus parallelus
Roeseliana roeselii
Stenobothrus lineatus
Stethophyma grossum
Tettigonia cantans
Tettigonia viridissima

And we are working on adding more (the highest priorities being Chrysacroan dispar, Omocestus viridulus and Phaneroptera falcata). 

You can use the classifier freely, without any charge (and without any warranty or liability). But please remember to cite our work. 

Please feel free to send an email (bennett@b-tu.de) if you have any questions or encounter any problems in using it!!
