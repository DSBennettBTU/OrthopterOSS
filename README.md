We recently developed a CNN based classifier using the opensoundscape system (Lapp et al. 2023), which runs in Python to automatically classifiy the songs of orthoptera (grasshoppers and bush crickets) which have been detected
on audio recorders, such as those used in passive acoustic monitoring of bats and birds. 

The original version refers to the one described in our recent publication 
("Recent technological developments allow for passive acoustic monitoring of Orthoptera (grasshoppers and crickets) in research and conservation across a broad range of temporal and spatial scales") 
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.baae.2025.03.004

This version currently classifies 17 species to a standard we consider acceptable, along with 3 more which we considered low accuracy at the time of the original publication.

You can use the classifier freely, without any charge (and without any warranty or liability). But please remember to cite our work. 

We plan to release new versions of the classifier with various improvements, such as more species and faster speed, in future. 

Please feel free to send an email if you have any questions or encounter any problems in using it!! (bennett@b-tu.de)
